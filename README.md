***Note:* This is discontinued with the release of CE-as-a-service (3.6+).**

CryENGINE 3 exporter for Softimage.

* Intuitive workflow for exporting.
* No special setup required for a basic export.
* CryEngine specific material properties directly interface with Softimage materials, so there is no restriction on the type of shaders/materials you can use in XSI.
* Batch export.
* Support for different grid-units (1 unit = 1cm or 1m).
* Animation export + straight forward animation clip editor.

Supports XSI ModTool 7.5, Softimage 2014 64bit (, Softimage 2012 SP1 64bit).

Required
========

Python 2.6+ (not Python 3), check https://sites.google.com/site/andescp/tut_pyxsi.
